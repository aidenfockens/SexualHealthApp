## HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT

### 0. Make sure all the dependencies are properly installed
# Open a bash terminal, cd io ./sexhealthapp, and type the following:

npm i

# ...assuming that you have node.js and node package manager (npm) installed.

### 1. Open a terminal, cd to ./sexhealthapp/src and type the following...

node server.js

### 2. cd to simply ./sexhealthapp and type the following in a new bash terminal ...

npm start

### A new tab should open in your default browser, likely //localhost:3000. You may now use the webapp.
